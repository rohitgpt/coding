    "### We run 10000 simulation for X and Y values. Year is discretised in 252 days. For all days X and Y are updated as X=X+dX and Y=Y+dY. If Ti = 0.25\\*i\\*years, payoff is calculated and all payoffs are summed at the end of the year. Expected value of payoff is calculated over all the simulation as mean of all the payoffs. Then price of the product is calculated using the formula given."
