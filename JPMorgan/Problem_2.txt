Problem Approach

Using the dynamics of given stock prices we simulated values of X and Y 
10000 times.
A day is treated as dt. And a year consists of 252 days.
Then
sigmaX, sigmaY are standard deviation of series {log(X_{t+1})-log(X_t)} and 
{log(Y_{t+1})-log(Y_t)} respectively
rho = pearsonr({log(X_{t+1})-log(X_t)},{log(Y_{t+1})-log(Y_t)}).
Then \epsilon_1 and \epsilon_2 are drawn from the bivariate normal distribution
with cross variance equal to rho

For every simulation, we calulated the payoff by adding all the payoffs when
Ti=t0 + 0.25*i*years.
The expected value of payoff is obtained using mean over all the simulations
Then, final price is calculated using the given formula
Price = E[Payoff]*exp(-1*r*T) where T = 252 days
